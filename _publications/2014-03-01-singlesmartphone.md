## Abstract

Generating a visually appealing human motion sequence using low-dimensional control signals is a major line of study in the motion research area in computer graphics. We propose a novel approach that allows to reconstruct full body human locomotion using a single smartphone. Smartphones are among the most widely used devices and include inertial sensors such as an accelerometer or a gyroscope. To find mapping between a full body pose and smartphone sensor data, we perform low dimensional embedding of full body motion capture data, based on a Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model. Our system ensures temporal coherence between the reconstructed poses by using a state decomposition model for automatic phase segmentation. Finally, application of our nonlinear regression algorithm finds a proper mapping between the latent space and the sensor data. Our framework effectively reconstructs plausible 3D locomotion sequences. We compare the generated animation to ground truth data that are obtained using a commercial motion capture system.
