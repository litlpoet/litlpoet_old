## Abstract

Generating a visually appealing human motion sequence using low-dimensional control signals is a major line of study in the motion research area in computer graphics. We propose a novel approach that allows us to reconstruct full body human locomotion using a single inertial sensing device, a smartphone. Smartphones are among the most widely used devices and incorporate inertial sensors such as an accelerometer and a gyroscope. To find a mapping between a full body pose and smartphone sensor data, we perform low dimensional embedding of full body motion capture data, based on a Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model. Our system ensures temporal coherence between the reconstructed poses by using a state decomposition model for automatic phase segmentation. Finally, application of the proposed nonlinear regression algorithm finds a proper mapping between the latent space and the sensor data. Our framework effectively reconstructs plausible 3D locomotion sequences. We compare the generated animation to ground truth data obtained using a commercial motion capture system.
